002-1000=The registered class {0} must be annotated with @LifecycleMeta or @StateMachine.
002-2100=A StateMachine metadata's super class {0} must also be StateMachine metadata, which should be annotated with @StateMachine.
002-2201=A StateMachine metadata class {0} should have @StateSet inner class.
002-2202=A StateMachine metadata class {0} should have ONLY ONE @StateSet inner class.
002-2203=A StateMachine metadata class {0} should have @TransitionSet inner class.
002-2204=A StateMachine metadata class {0} should have ONLY ONE @TransitionSet inner class.
002-2300=A StateSet metadata class {0} should have state classes defined as inner classes. 
002-2400=A StateSet metadata class {0} must have @Inital State class defined as inner classes.
002-2401=A StateSet metadata class {0} should have ONLY one @Initial state defined.
002-2500=A StateSet metadata class {0} should have at least one @End (final) state defined as inner classes.
002-2610=Function {0} on state class {1} has invalid transition reference {2}. Transition reference should not beyond the owning StateMachine's TransitionSet or owning StateMachine's super StateMachines' Transition Set.
002-2611=Function {0} on state class {1} refers to the transition {2} and have multiple next state candidates, so the transition {2} should be a conditional transition, but there is no @Conditional associated with it.  
002-2612=Function {0} on state class {1} refers to the transition {2} which go beyond the StateMachine's transitionSet scope inside a composite state.
