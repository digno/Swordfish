002-2201=A StateMachine metadata class {0} should have @StateSet inner class.
002-2202=A StateMachine metadata class {0} should have ONLY ONE @StateSet inner class.
002-2203=A StateMachine metadata class {0} should have @TransitionSet inner class.
002-2204=A StateMachine metadata class {0} should have ONLY ONE @TransitionSet inner class.

002-2611=Function {0} on state class {1} refers to the transition {2} and have multiple next state candidates, so the transition {2} should be a conditional transition, but there is no @Conditional associated with it.

002-2613=Function {0} on state class {1} is invalid, @End state should have no transitions.
002-2700=The next state set of function {0} on state {1} of state machine {2} is invalid. Please make sure the state in next state set of function exists in {2} StateSet or super StateMachines' StateSet.

002-2801=The state {0} of state machine {1} annotated with @ShortCut should be a @End state. Please add @End annotation.
002-2911=The class {0} of relation attribute of @InBoundWhile on state {1} must be defined in StateMachine {2}'s RelationSet or it's super StateMachine's RelationSet, recursively.
002-2912=Each state in On state set of @InBoundWhile on state {1} should be defined in Related StateMachine {2}'s state set or it's super StateMachine's state set.
